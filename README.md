Project Euler
=============

* I am not super good in Math meaning that some challenges aren't really optimized.
* The language used is C#.
* Each challenge has its own static method. See program.cs to see how to.
* Each program should work with other values than the ones asked in the challenge. I tried to make it as dynamic as possible.
* I learn and optimize as I progress through the challenges and don't automatically update previous challenges.

####euler0.cs
* Contains challenges 1->10

####euler1.cs
* Contains challenges 11->20 (missing 15 & 18)

##To do (12.08.2014)

* ~~Challenge 3 : I have to find a faster way (bruteforce atm)~~ Done !
* Challenges 15 & 18
