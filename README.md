Project Euler
=============

* I am not super good in Math meaning that some challenges aren't really optimized.
* The language used is C#.
* Each challenge has its own file with a static class and method. Use it as follow => euler#.method();
* Each program should work with other values than the ones asked in the challenge. I tried to make it as dynamic as possible.
* I learn and optimize as I progress through the challenges and don't automatically update previous challenges.

* Challenge 3 : I have to find a faster way (bruteforce atm)
* Challenges > 10
